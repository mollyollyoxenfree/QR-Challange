### What I learned

This was my first coding challenge. I just started taking a web development course through udemy. We just finished learning the basics of html and CSS.  So far, it's been a good experience. Frustrating at times. I have a long way to go. This challenge was harder than I expected. I'd appreciate feedback on how I could improve my code or organize things differenly.


### Continued development

I would like to get more comfortable with sizing and positioning elements.
